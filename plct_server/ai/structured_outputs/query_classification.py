CLASSIFY_QUERY_DESCRIPTION = """
Classify the user's question as referring to a course, the current lecture, the platform, or unsure.

- **course** Used when the question is about the course in general, including overall topics or materials.

- **current_lecture** classification is used when the question is about the current lecture. 

- **platform** classification is used when the question is about the petlja.org LMS platform where the course is hosted.

- **unsure** classification is used when you aren't sure how to classify the query.

CONVERSATION_CONTINUATION_DESCRIPTION = """
Two follow-up suggestions that the user can click to have the assistant perform the action on their behalf.
Take into account history and avoid repeating the same suggestions.

These suggestions should be **concise and actionable**â€”representing things the assistant can do for the user (like generating content or performing tasks).

Focus on providing clear, **action-oriented commands** the assistant can execute directly when clicked.

Example:
- Create a test for the current lecture.
- Create a homework for the current lecture.

**Avoid verbose descriptions or questions.** The suggestions should be brief and phrased as direct actions.

Always answer in the language of the question.
