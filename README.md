# PLCT Server

*This project is in the proof-of-concept stage.*

PLCT (Petlja Learning Content Tools) Server is a simple server designed to serve learning content built using PLCT. It may be launched locally using PLCT CLI or deployed as a standalone service. 

PLCT content is basically static HTML5, but some features of PLCT components may be limited without server-side support, like features based on AI or other server-side computation.

PLCT Server aims to provide the reference PLCT platform implementation suitable for development, demonstration, and simple production scenarios. PCLT Server is an OSS product designed to be easily adapted/integrated to meet specific needs.
